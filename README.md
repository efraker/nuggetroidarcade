## 📚 **Step 1: Your First Change (Add Questions)**

Let's start by adding some questions to an existing game. It's like adding new cards to a card game!

### **🎮 What You'll Do:**
Add 3 new questions about your favorite animals to History Ninja.

### **📂 Step-by-Step:**

#### **1.1: Get Ready**
1. Go to your GitHub repository (the place where your game code lives)
2. Click on the `src` folder, then `games`, then `history-ninja` 
3. Open Claude.ai in another tab
4. Copy this prompt:

```
I want to add 3 new questions about my favorite animals to the history-ninja game. Please add them to a new category called 'favorite-animals'. Each question should have 3 regular wrong answers and 1 funny "zany" answer.

My favorite animals are:
- [Write your 3 favorite animals here]

Please show me exactly what to add to the history-facts.js file.
```

#### **1.2: Ask Claude for Help**
1. Paste the prompt into Claude.ai
2. Replace `[Write your 3 favorite animals here]` with your actual favorite animals
3. Drag the `history-ninja` folder from GitHub into Claude (this gives Claude context)
4. Press Enter and wait for Claude's response

#### **1.3: Copy Claude's Code**
Claude will give you code that looks like this:
```javascript
'favorite-animals': [
  {
    fact: "What is the largest land animal?",
    answers: [
      { text: "Elephant", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "Giraffe", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Rhinoceros", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "My pet hamster when he's really fluffy", isCorrect: false, isZany: true }
    ]
  }
  // ... more questions
]
```

#### **1.4: Add It to Your Game**
1. Go back to GitHub
2. Click on `history-facts.js` 
3. Click the pencil icon (Edit) 
4. Scroll to the bottom of the file, before the very last `};`
5. Add a comma `,` after the last category
6. Paste Claude's code there
7. Click "Commit changes" (the green button)
8. Wait about 30 seconds, then visit your GitHub Pages site to test!

### **🎉 What Happens:**
When you play History Ninja, you'll see your new "Favorite Animals" category! Click it and answer your own questions. The funny "zany" answers will make cool smoke effects!
